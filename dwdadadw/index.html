  <h1>About Aung La Nsang</h1>
  <img src="Aung_La_N_Sang.jpg" alt="Aung La Nsang">
  <p><strong>La Maung Nsang</strong> (Burmese: အောင်လအန်ဆန်း; born on May 21, 1985) is a Burmese and American mixed martial artist. He is currently signed to ONE Championship, where he competes in both the middleweight and light heavyweight divisions. He is a former ONE Middleweight and ONE Light Heavyweight World Champion, and was the second two-division champion in ONE history, having held both belts simultaneously.</p>
  <p>He made his MMA debut in 2005 and became a major star in his native Myanmar after signing with ONE Championship and winning two titles with the organization.</p>
  <p>He is also one of the few Myanmar citizens with an international profile, given the country only began opening up to the outside world over the last decade. Aung La was the subject of unprecedented national attention in the lead-up to the fight with Russia's then-middleweight champion Vitaly Bigdash, with billboards across Yangon featuring massive portraits of the two fighters.</p>
  <p>Being a national icon of Myanmar, his own bronze statue was erected in 2018 at the Kachin National Manau Park in his hometown of Myitkyina.</p>
